# Hi! I'm Blake Erickson

![blake labs circa 2004](https://blake.app/assets/img/DSCF0008.JPG)

I’m a software developer and builder. I’ve been programming and diving deep into the depths of computers since I was a teenager and 20+ years later I still can’t get enough. I’m most experienced building (and scaling!) web apps with Ruby/Rails and JavaScript, but I’m quickly falling in love with Rust and TypeScript as my tools of choice.

I currently work at [Aha!](https://www.aha.io/) as a Senior Software Developer on the Knowledge team. 🚀

Previously, I spent just shy of 9 years at Discourse as a Senior Software Engineer. I was an early employee (#11) and worked in many different capacities from devops like roles, doing feature development in Rails and Emberjs, to working closely with enterprise customers and users to build an amazing product they love.

I thrive on solving customer problems as well as improving the tools we use every day. My favorite moments come from delivering unanticipated delight when shipping ideas that merge naturally from deep product knowledge and a strong sense of what users are really after.

Outside of work, I’m a husband, parent, snowboarder, and car nerd. If I’m not at a keyboard, I’m probably tinkering on a Subaru in my garage, or escaping up in the mountains to snowboard somewhere in Idaho.
